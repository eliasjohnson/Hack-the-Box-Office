<h1>Books</h1>
<p>
A book, a book, my kingdom for a book, or something like that. <br>
The longing feeling of wishing that there was more when you come to the end of a book that kept you captivated. <br>
A deep sense of unease at the thoughts and actions of an entirely fictional character, or pure joy at two imagined beings' love story. Books that have it all. <br><br>

We have been at the receiving end of a book recommendation, and the giving end too. <br>
Nothing seems to bore you more than feeling like you have to read a book you don't want too. <br><br>

Books should be fun, you should feel like you cant put it down. <br>
We read, and re-read the ones we love, and having a book make its way into your heart make you all the more inclined to recommend it. <br><br>

Here we will discuss literature, from fantasy to non-fiction, and give you the best reasons as to why you should care.
