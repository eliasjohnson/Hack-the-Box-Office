<p>Have you ever watched a movie and felt like it was a complete waste of time? Have you ever left the theater with your friend and said "Well that sucked!" only for them to say, "I don't know, I kinda liked it." You ask why, incredulously, ready with all the plot holes and discrepancies that have now become bullets to shoot holes in your friend's defense of enjoyment.
</p>
<p>
Part of what makes Movies, or any media worth talking about is the fact that two people, with slightly different perspectives can take completely different things away from a story. 
</p>
<p>
It's not your fault a coming of age story isn't relatable at 65, any more that you could fault a child for not understanding the emotional implications of a midlife crisis at the young age of 8. 
</p>
<p>
That brings us in, we wonâ€™t attempt to make a plea, or convert you to our gospel of media. Rather, we will simply tell you why we, and why you, should care. 
</p>
<p>
Having someone express why a piece of art means so much to you can be incredibly fulfilling, that is our objective, to start conversations and analysis of our favorite things. Maybe you won't care, maybe you already do, but at least we can tell you why.
