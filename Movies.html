	<p>Have you ever watched a movie and felt like it was a complete waste of time? <br>
	Have you ever left the theater with your friend and said "Well that sucked!" only for them to say, "I don't know, I kinda liked it." <br><br>
	You ask why, incredulously, ready with all the plot holes and discrepancies that have now become bullets to shoot holes in your friend's defense of enjoyment.<br>

	Part of what makes Movies, or any media worth talking about is the fact that two people, with slightly different perspectives can take completely different things away from a story. <br>

	It's not your fault a coming of age story isn't relatable at 65, any more that you could fault a child for not understanding the emotional implications of a midlife crisis at the young age of 8. <br><br>

	That brings us in, we wonâ€™t attempt to make a plea, or convert you to our gospel of media. <br> 
	Rather, we will simply tell you why we, and why you, should care. <br>

	Having someone express why a piece of art means so much to you can be incredibly fulfilling, that is our objective, to start conversations and analysis of our favorite things. <br>
	Maybe you won't care, maybe you already do, but at least we can tell you why. <br>
