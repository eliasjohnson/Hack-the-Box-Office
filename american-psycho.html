                <div>A wealthy New York City investment banking executive, Patrick Bateman,
                    hides his alternate psychopathic ego from his co-workers and friends as he delves deeper into his violent, hedonistic fantasies.

                <div>Now it all makes sense. Christian Bale was born to play horror characters. 
                    I couldn't understand why I was so , so, afraid of him even in films like "Velvet Goldmine" 
                    He is a poster boy for putrid souls in elegant wrapping. In "American Psycho" - 
                    a film that deserves much more attention than it's got - he is absolutely terrific. 
                    Totally believable. I could sense his delight in playing a monster of this kind. 
                    Interestingly enough this manicured monster seems to be asking for sympathy, imagine the nerve! 
                    But Christian Bale succeeds in showing us a face we (I) hadn't quite seen before and yet we (I) accept without question. 
                    He should have gotten an Oscar nomination but, fortunately, he didn't.

                    This movie is a masterpiece, and it is so underrated. So many quotable moments, true perfect cult piece. 
                    Violence is measured, much milder than in the book, which is improved on. 
                    It shows the true side of Wall Street morality, of all the little Eichmanns that lived and still live in Manhattan. 
                    Dark comedy genius, with classic shiny ax scene perfectly in tune with "Hip to be Square" music, 
                    that Weird Al and Huey Lewis parodied in perfect meta homage. This movie works on so many levels, 
                    and although it was hated by the corporate elite and their paid hypocrite critics, 
                    time has shown that this movie is going to last. This is Wolf of Wall Street on steroids, 
                    wrapped in metaphysical, if murderous, clothing.

                    By the end, I didn't know what to make of it, but now I understand the film much better. 
                    This film is must viewing, it brings out the truth about today's world - Nothing but material values matter, 
                    we live empty lives, we think empty thoughts, we are empty people, life is boring. <br>
                    Christian Bale is awesome, quality acting! Willem Dafoe was underused, 
                    I didn't think the support cast had the same quality material as Bale. <br>
                    The photography is stylish, very 80s gloss! <br>
                    The direction is terrific, wonderful camera work. <br>
                    Overall, see it, it's satire, black comedy, social commentary and more!
