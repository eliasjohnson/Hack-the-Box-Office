                    This was a perfect sequel to Denis' part one. It accomplished all the main plot points of the book while delivering stellar 
                    performances and visuals that most films only dream of having. This film will go down as one of the best in sci-fi/fantasy 
                    and it deserves all the laurels it will be gifted. Not in the longest time has a franchise, and a singular movie, captivated 
                    me in such a way. This story, these characters, this planet, Dune, lives rent-free in my mind. You would be doing yourself a 
                    disservice not seeing this film in IMAX, as the soundscapes created and the soundtrack by Hans Zimmer are so immersive you 
                    feel like you are a part of every scene. This movie is a masterpiece in storytelling. 10/10.

                    We have waited many, many years for a movie of this caliber. I'm 59 years old, a female, grandmother and retired - 
                    this was THE. BEST. MOVIE I have ever seen. I don't tend to like si-fi movies so I went along with my husband as a favor. 
                    The length of this movie wasn't even noticed by us; it wasn't long enough to be honest. We wanted MORE. 
                    It ended and we weren't done yet. We know how long it takes for sequels to come along - so who knows if I'll still be 
                    on the planet to see it. I hope I am. And I hope they can do it justice. The last time I remember a movie being THIS good: 
                    I was in high school in the 80's. DO NOT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THIS MOVIE IN THE THEATRE. CRAZY GOOD.

                    I just got out of an early access showing and it was absolutely incredible. 
                    See for yourself in IMAX. The characters, acting, screenplay, world building, storytelling, score, actions sequences, 
                    cinematography, and everything in between make for a cinematic masterpiece. Denis Villeneuve provides a masterclass of 
                    filmmaking. The casting continuation was perfect all the way through, with great new add-ons. Timothee Chalamet is 
                    believable, raw and real as Paul Atriedes. He was flawless as the lead. Zendaya, Rebecca Ferguson, Javier Bardem, 
                    and Josh Brolin are fantastic per usual. Stellan Skarsgard and Dave Bautista continue their evil. Austin Butler steals 
                    the show as Feyd-Rautha, and Florence Pugh and Christopher Walken are solid fresh casts.<br>
                    Overall, Dune: Part Two is an inspiring, visually stunning sci-fi spectacle and an incredible 
                    collision of myth, adventure, and destiny on a galactic scale. It's a fantastic piece of filmmaking, 
                    rarely seen in modern day cinema.
