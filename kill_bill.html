                    The music first is breathtaking. The action is mind boggling. The animation is something magical. 
                    I am going to see all of the Kill Bills. Uma Thurman redefines herself and every woman alive. 
                    This is Wonder Woman times 10. Bravo Terrantino you deserve kudos for this majestic work

                    This is movie is unusual, but it works for me. It kept me intrigued from the beginning with the plot which is not 
                    entirely clearly, but that made it more interesting for me. There's a lot of action in the movie which I found 
                    excellent and enjoyed a lot. It might not be realistic, but its a movie so it doesn't have to be. The plot is 
                    amazing and I can't wait to watch volume 2 soon because of how intriguing volume 1 was.

                    Like many of Tarantino's films, this movie features exaggerated, action-packed, and gruesome fight scenes, 
                    but with a darkly comedic element. The main plot of this film is an anonymous woman who is referred to as 
                    "The Bride" is shot by a man named Bill, with whom she used to be acquainted with. She is then in a coma for 
                    four years and when she awakes is fearless when preparing to fight Bill and the other members of his Deadly 
                    Viper Assassination Squad. While it is in the style of a classic, action-packed thriller, this movie is anything 
                    but ordinary. With exaggerated and comedic, but still suspenseful fight scenes, intelligent dialogue, 
                    stellar acting, and more this is a must-see for all Tarantino fans, martial arts movie fans, action movie fans, 
                    and anyone else who wants to enjoy the first two of four hours of purely entertaining from start to finish action.
