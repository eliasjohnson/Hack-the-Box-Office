                        targets her and her friends by using scary movies as part of a deadly game.

                    <div>With Scream (1996), Wes Craven re-invented & revitalised the slasher genre with this modern horror classic, 
                        Scream is funny, clever & scary, as a fright-masked knife maniac stalks high-school students. 
                        A beautiful love letter to horror movies that came before it. A truly classic horror film. 
                        What a genius Wes Craven was. Brilliant film making. Defines 90s horror.

                    <div>
                        Watching this film for the first time in the basement of a four story house, with no-one else in was the 
                        perfect setting for this film. From the very first scene I was gripped and I could not wait for the 
                        climax to discover the murderer and his motives. The script was extremely original, as they had 
                        purposely set out to parodie the typical slasher style movie.It was written in a way that deceived and 
                        tricked and had you jumping out of your seats but also laughing at the paradoxical black humour. For anyone 
                        looking for a good horror film with a twist, you won't find a better one than Scream.

                        Scream single-handedly revitalized the slasher genre, which was beyond dead as of 1996, 
                        and inspired countless spin-offs and attempted remakes in its wake. 
                        Wes Craven creates yet another horror masterpiece, and does so in an original and unique way. 
                        Add in the witty, self aware, reference-filled script by Kevin Williamson, 
                        which was rumored to have taken influence from Friday the 13th Pt 6, and you have one of the most 
                        iconic slashers ever made. Arguably the greatest opening scene to a horror movie ever, along with so 
                        many more iconic lines and scenes (Randy watching Halloween on the couch). The acting is next level 
                        by horror/slasher standards and has a very likable cast. Skeet Ulrich giving his best performance of 
                        his career, Matthew Lillard, Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, Drew Barrymore ... 
                        do i need to go on? The influence and impact Scream had on the late 90's is undeniable, 
                        simply one of the best scary movies of all time.
